# gender_classification_challenge

three classifications added
head circumference (no growth area, men known to have larger skulls to women)
wrist (minimal influence from fatty deposits, again wrist larger for men)
calves (chosen for reason that different ethnic groups have smaller/larger calves aswell generally larger in men)

Did consider chest and waist circumference however flat chested non pregnant women could potientally come up as men atleast that's my reasoning.  Also found it uncomfortable, for both parties, asking to take measurements of chest.
using chest and waist circumference below Age < adult would in my opinion skew the data   
Age is an issue that would need to be addressed.  Any Male/female below final growth spurt would skew the data
